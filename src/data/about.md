# Intro

I am a senior IT professional, with skills in system administration and software development (full stack).
# Currently
In MyPass, a start-up based in Torino (Italy). Our mission is creating innovative technology that lets people enter museums, ski tracks, parkings, etc... and pay directly while always paying the best prices. I primarily work as a systemist and developer but have broad experience across MyPassâ€™s stack.
